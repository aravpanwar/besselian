"""Lodging supply from OpenStreetMap extracts.

Supply, never price. Counting rooms is not the same as knowing what they cost,
and this project does not publish prices: a count of beds within reach of a
place is sourceable from open data and stays true indefinitely, whereas a price
is a scrape with a shelf life.

The argument the counts support: supply thins toward the centreline. Scarcity is
what produces a markup, so a town with six guest houses and a town with six
hundred hotel rooms are different propositions at the same duration, and that
difference is visible without quoting a single rate.

Read from Geofabrik country extracts at build time. Overpass is deliberately not
used: the brief forbids depending on volunteer-run infrastructure, and a
corridor-sized Overpass query returned 504 in testing.
