"""Travel advisories from the FCDO, fetched at build time.

Queried once per build and committed, never per visitor. The brief requires the
issuing body and the date checked to be shown, and both come straight from the
feed rather than being asserted by hand.

Handling is deliberately soft but unmissable: the advisory attaches to the
country group, never to individual rows, and nothing is hidden or reordered
because of it. A ranking that optimises for duration, clear sky and low crowds
will surface places under serious advisories at the top, because on those axes
they genuinely win. The map should not lie about what is in the path.
