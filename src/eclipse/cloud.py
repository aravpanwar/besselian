"""Cloud cover climatology from ERA5 reanalysis.

What this answers: on the calendar date of the eclipse, at the hour the eclipse
happens there, how often has this place historically been cloudy?

Method: ERA5 total cloud cover, hourly, sampled for a window of years on the
eclipse date and the surrounding days, at the UT hour of local maximum eclipse.
The mean over years is the climatological probability; nothing here is a
forecast, and it cannot be. A forecast for 2 August 2027 will exist about a
week before the event and will be far more useful than any of this.

Why ERA5 rather than the satellite record: Jay Anderson's eclipsophile.com is
the domain standard and states no licence, so its tables cannot be
redistributed under an open licence. ERA5 is free, documented and citable.
Link to Anderson, never copy him.

Known limitations, all of which belong on the page next to the number:

- 0.25 degree grid, about 28 km. That is coarser than the terrain in much of
  this path. One ERA5 cell can span the Nile valley and the desert plateau
  beside it, which have genuinely different cloud behaviour. Treat the number
  as regional, not local.
- Reanalysis is a model constrained by observations, not an observation. Its
  cloud fields are among its weaker variables.
- A climatological mean over a window of years hides the spread. Two places at
  20% can differ in whether that is one year in five totally overcast or five
  years all hazy.
- Averaging days around the date trades date-specificity for sample size. That
  is the right trade for a 40-year window, but it is a trade.
